Java Generics Wildcards

Question mark (?) is the wildcard in generics and represent an unknown type.
The wildcard can be used as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable
and sometimes as a return type. We canâ€™t use wildcards while invoking a generic
method or instantiating a generic class.

Java Generics Type Erasure

Generics in Java was added to provide type-checking at compile time and it has no
use at run time, so java compiler uses type erasure feature to remove all the generics
type checking code in byte code and insert type-casting if necessary. Type erasure ensures
that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.
