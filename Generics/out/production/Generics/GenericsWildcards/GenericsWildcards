Java Generics Wildcards

Question mark (?) is the wildcard in generics and represent an unknown type.
The wildcard can be used as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable
and sometimes as a return type. We canâ€™t use wildcards while invoking a generic
method or instantiating a generic class.
